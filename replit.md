# PlaySyncer

PlayStation account subscription management platform — tracks games, shared accounts, capacity slots, and customer order assignments.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/playsyncer run dev` — frontend dev server (React/Vite)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — API server (Express 5, port 8080)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec
- `./scripts/setup.sh` — one-command setup after a fresh import or export (installs deps, builds shared libs, applies migrations)

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- **API:** Express 5, Zod validation, pino logging
- **DB:** PostgreSQL (Replit-managed) + Drizzle ORM 0.45
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite 7, TailwindCSS 4, React Router, TanStack Query
- **Validation:** Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- **API codegen:** Orval (from OpenAPI spec in `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`)
- **Build:** esbuild (CJS bundle for api-server)

## API Routes (all under /api)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /healthz | Health check |
| GET | /games | List games with account count |
| POST | /games | Create game |
| GET | /games/:id | Get single game |
| PATCH | /games/:id | Update game |
| DELETE | /games/:id | Soft delete game |
| GET | /games/:gameId/accounts | List safe account summaries for a game (no secrets) |
| POST | /games/:gameId/accounts | **Disabled** — account creation is not authorized |
| GET | /accounts/:id | **Disabled** — detail routes may expose secrets |
| PATCH | /accounts/:id | **Disabled** — account editing is not authorized |
| DELETE | /accounts/:id | **Disabled** — account deletion is not authorized |
| GET | /accounts/:accountId/capacities | Capacity slots with active customers |
| POST | /capacities/:capacityId/customers | Assign customer to slot |
| PATCH | /capacities/:capacityId/customers/:id | Edit customer assignment |
| DELETE | /capacities/:capacityId/customers/:id | Soft-remove customer |
| GET | /orders | List orders |
| GET | /orders/:id | Get single order |
| POST | /orders | Create order (normalizes order code) |

## Database schema

8 tables: `admins`, `games`, `accounts`, `account_backup_codes`, `account_capacities`, `orders`, `capacity_customers`, `audit_logs`

Key constraints:
- `accounts.email_normalized`: partial unique WHERE `deleted_at IS NULL` (legacy, scheduled for removal in PS-03C2B)
- `capacity_customers(capacity_id, order_id)`: partial unique WHERE `status = 'active'` (unchanged)
- `account_capacities(account_id, capacity_kind, instance_no)`: unique constraint (legacy, scheduled for removal in PS-03C2B)

## Capacity rules (fixed — do not change)

| Platform | Slots |
|----------|-------|
| PS5_ONLY | Z2 PS5 #1, Z2 PS5 #2, Z3 Shared PS5/PS4 |
| PS4_AND_PS5 | Z2 PS5 #1, Z2 PS5 #2, Z2 PS4, Z3 Shared PS5/PS4 |
| PS4_ONLY | Z2 PS4 |

`instanceNo`: Z2_PS5 uses 1/2, singletons use 0.

## Architecture decisions

- **Soft deletes everywhere** — `deleted_at` timestamp, never hard delete
- **Encrypted column naming** — `*Encrypted` suffix for sensitive fields; actual encryption not yet wired (plaintext stored in dev)
- **Order code normalization** — `ORD-<number>` canonical form, no leading zeros; `normalizeOrderCode()` in `lib/db/src/helpers/order-code.ts`
- **Persistent capacity slots** — created once on account registration; platform changes do NOT regenerate slots
- **accountCode globally unique** — `ACC-000001` format; `displayNumber` = `#PREFIX-001`
- **Partial unique index via Drizzle** — uses `.where(sql\`...\`)` syntax, compatible with drizzle-kit 0.31+

## Environment variables required

- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string (auto-provided by Replit)
- `PORT` — server port (auto-provided by Replit per artifact)
- `BASE_PATH` — URL base path (auto-provided by Replit per artifact)
- `SESSION_SECRET` — session signing secret

## Gotchas

- `pnpm run build` for playsyncer/api-server requires `PORT` and `BASE_PATH` env vars (injected by Replit workflow system; cannot run `build` standalone)
- `lib/db` uses `"type": "module"` — esbuild handles import resolution at api-server build time
- `req.params` in Express 5 types is `string | string[]` — use the `p()` helper from `src/lib/req-param.ts`
- `nextAccountCode()` and `nextSeqForGame()` in accounts.ts are race-condition-prone under concurrent load — replace with PostgreSQL sequences before production

## Account Core phase notes

- **PS-03C1** — APPROVED & CLOSED. Migration `0002_warm_swarm.sql` is frozen; it added immutable identifiers, per-game counters, encrypted/lookup-hash columns, and FINISHED capacity state.
- **PS-03C2A** — IMPLEMENTED, AWAITING COMMAND CENTER REVIEW. Runtime code was refactored so Account POST/PATCH/DELETE/GET-detail are disabled and fail-closed; generic Account DTOs no longer return secrets; `Z3_PS5` Runtime dependency was replaced with `Z3_SHARED_PS5_PS4`; Backup Code Runtime contract was reduced to storage-only (`id`, `account_id`, `code_ciphertext`, `created_at`). No migration, schema metadata, or live database changes occurred.
- **PS-03C2B** — NOT STARTED. Will create migration `0003` to retire the legacy Account/Backup Code/Capacity fields identified in `reports/ps03c2b_retirement_inventory.md`.
